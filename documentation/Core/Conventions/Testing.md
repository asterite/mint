# Testing

## Dummy Data

This section shows what kind of dummy data to use in tests.

### String

When testing `String` related functions use these:

- Anagram: `"Rail Safety" "Fairy Tails"`
- Codepoints: `"☃★♲"`
- CodePoint: `"☃"`
- Character: `"A"`
- Word: `"Hello"`

These sentences can be used (with modification):

- Short sentence: `"The quick brown fox jumps."`

## Emails, URLs

When testing emails or URLs use the `example.com` domain.
